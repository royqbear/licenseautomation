# licenseautomation
a project for my current workplace automating the process of buying or canceling licenses, with login (using environmental variables) 
dynamically related to specific login.

the process is :
login(to app locally) > app\gui that shows a list of all available licenses to buy or cancel (microsoft 365) based on the user's login details.
after choosing 4 elements(company,buy\cancel,amount,and name) the code will do the rest of the job, at the end an automatic email is sent from the suppliers website to make sure the process is completed successfuly
